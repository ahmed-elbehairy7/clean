# Clean

This is a basic script to clean your temp files whenever your computer boots up

## Setup

Just run the setup command by typing it's path at the cmd or double clicking it from explorer. Congratulations! Everything should be pretty much done now!

    setup.bat

To check if setup is done correctly, press the <code>windows key + r</code> and type <code>shell:startup</code>, and you should see a copy of the file there. If it's not there, just take it and copy it

Actually, the setup script just copies the clean.bat to your startup directory, it should be something like this, at least for me

    C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\

You can also google it on your own how to set an application to run on startup, it might be updated by the time you see this
