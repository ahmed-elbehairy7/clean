# Clean

This is a basic script to clean your temp files whenever your computer boots up

## Setup

> **WARNING :: DANGER :: WARNING :: DANGER:** Your antivirus can really delete the whole cmd so please consider the next step

### First: Turn off real time protection

My antivirus tried to delete the cmd from the system! So, make sure to turn it off to prevent that from happening, and the code is all yours already, trust me! it's safe!!

### Second: Extract clean.rar

The password: "read the danger sign above"

### Finaly: Run setup.bat

This step should be pretty obvious!

### Congratulations

Now it's time to check if everything went alright

## Check

To check if setup is done correctly, press "windows key + r" and type "shell:startup", and you should see a shortcut there named clean.vbs. If it's not there, make sure that you ran the setup.bat as administrator, also, make sure your antivirus not causing problems then try again, if it still not working, check the manual setup section below

## manual setup

### 1. Replace replaceMe

replace the word replaceMe in the file start.vbs with the path to the main.bat file

### 3. copy the file to the startup directory

As mentioned before, you can go to the startup directory by pressing "windows key + r" then typing "shell::startup" in the textbox that appears, it should be something like this:

    C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\

### 5. Congratulations!

Congratulations! Everything should be pretty done by now, you can check temp folders then run the clean.vbs to see it working.
